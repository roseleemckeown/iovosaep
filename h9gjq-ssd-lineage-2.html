I'm looking for a low cost pc to run Nox/Blue Stacks emulator for Lineage 2 Revolution mmorpg. I found this list off techbuyersguru.com for a 0 or less office computer build. I'm not sure if I would need to add a video card or if the AMD Ryzen 2200g will be sufficient alone. I have windows 10 from my old desktop I was hoping to transfer to this build. I'm also planning on buying everything from my local Microcenter and they don't have this case so what else would be a good option? Processor. О программе. lineage 2 sl – торговый бот.

Currently, I have a HP Revolve 810 G3, that is not that old, and still under warranty. You would think that the title of the laptop, which advertises apparent MIL-STD-810 and could tolerate a small 30cm drop from an ensemble bed and whatnot, but this one didn't survive.

Hi all, I have a strange problem. I'm trying to build LineageOS 16.0 but somehow libbcc fails to build on my PC (Ubuntu 18.04, bcc package explicitly installed but still fails) but succeeds on my laptop (Ubuntu 18.04, bcc package not installed). The manifests and local manifests are exactly the same on both machines and I even deleted the whole folder and started `repo init ` from scratch on both to be sure but it still fails and succeeds, respectively. Is there any starting point I could. Компания Wired Productions представила новый трейлер хоррора от первого лица Close to the Sun, вместе с тем объявив дату релиза игры. Hi fellow FreeNAS Redditors!

I recently bought a phone (mi max 3) and I was thinking about trying to port LOS there. I have no experience building roms, but I have decent experience using the command line as well as some basic java knowledge. I have a fairly powerful laptop with an SSD, so I believe that my hardware is good enough to build on. From the basic research I did, I found that when porting lineage it helps to start with a similar device that has an official build. How similar is the redmi

Hello all. I want to build a new PC for 2 reasons. 1. because my old PC has been acting strange. Lately I've been playing Lineage 2 Classic and when I have 3 clients running, (im mentioning this cause this may be the issue) my computer lags off game. Ex. Mumble, discord, chrome. But the game itself is fine. During these issues I checked my task manager and my CPU was running at 103% (not sure if that's normal). 2. I just like building PC's and I am itching to do one again lol. So these

Regarding Re-Perks: First of all yes - game is grindy. Grind is not for everyone. In one or another way most of the time we will have to change 2-4 perks on weapon. How many mission do we need to farm to be able to swap perk ? I don't know exact numbers 'cause I don't farm it. Don't get me wrong - I was playing MMO like WoW, SWTOR, Lineage and I know what the grind is. But this isnt feel like "rewarding" grind. Just time consuming. We have Obliterator. I installed the latest Bluestacks using the installer from their official page on a fresh new out of the box laptop: windows 10, i7 8750H 2.2ghz, 16gb ddr4 2666 dual channel, gtx 1070 8gb and a samsung 970 pro ssd. I installed Lineage 2 revolution, trying every setting I could think of including using bluestacks tweaker and changing system settings. After all of that I can manage 2 hours before the app crashes. In fact it crashes as much as my 4gb Moto G5 plus. Why does bluestacks only allow. I'm using a Moto G3 running LineageOS. I have a 32-gig SD card and 8 gigs of internal storage. I set up shared storage, but even though I have close to 30 gigs available on the SSD I'm getting a "storage space is running out" warning. Since it's shared storage I don't see a way to actually move anything on to the SD. Do I have any options. Hi guys happy Valentine's day! I'm back again with a few more items to sell due to upgrades in my life Items: ~~Sandisk 240GB SSD -  (CDI image included in imgur link below)~~ Moto G4+ - 0 (Comes with black TPU case, rooted and unlocked running LineageOS, extremely minor cosmetic damage on the lower left corner that is easily covered by the TPU case) iPhone 7 128gb - 0 (Rose Gold, GSM, no cosmetic damage) I'll go 50/50 on shipping, and try to ship the item within 24 hours Alright, I've got way too much stuff here left over from past projects and hobby builds (not even everything is listed here, maybe in the future) but for the time being, I'm going to sell off whatever I don't really need/want gone. I can't really set a definitive price on everything, so please make me a starting offer in PM and we'll definitely work out the price, because I'm not even sure what some of this stuff is even worth in the market today, so I'll put a placeholder price beside the items. I start playing Lineage Revolution on BlueStacks and a pop up windows shows up giving me the option to download something called "xPack" https://i.imgur.com/GXfBSGB.jpg (https://i.imgur.com/GXfBSGB.jpg) and say it will make my game experience better, now the question i download it or not?

( local buyers i have 2 more pcs that are on craigslsit. 
Hi guys. This is not an end-all guide. Just basic security practices that I use. I think it would be beneficial to all if we keep a sticky on best practices for newbs that needs place to start. Create an Encrypted Sparse image on your drive(256k encryption is preferable) -Use at least 32 alpha numeric mixed case password. -Use this encrypted sparse image as the repository for your third party email app. (thunderbird for example) -Use this encrypted sparse image as the repository for your third. Hey guys ! So, after around 10-15 minutes of any usage of nox emulator(with facebook,reddit to simple games and more demanding visually games like Lineage II and Destiny 6) I start to get : CPU spike to around 15-20 Choppy video with frame skipping Internet connection issues None of them appear on Bluestacks with DirectX on max DPI with 2 cores and 2240 ram, but I don't want to use it because I very much prefer what Nox offers with the layout, and various other settings so im trying to upgrade my existing cpu. hoping to reuse the liquid cooler for cpu/case/powersupply/ssds/got new 1060gpu last summer. this is my first time doing this. my existing computer is an alienware aurora. about 7-8 years old. wondering if this stuff will just plug and play into it, https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/yYcZBP any thoughts on things i might change to get more bang for my buck. looking to play multiple instances of lineage 2 revolution and stream. and other games as well. Hi community! I would like to upgrade my old Fujitsu laptop (with Celeron B830 CPU), so it will be huge difference anyways. But I just can't decide which one should I pick. I can get refurbished T430 with 1 year warranty with specs (5): i5-3320M (HD4000), 8 GB RAM, 320 GB HDD, 1600x900px, backlit keyboard or T440p with unspecified Lenovo warranty with specs (5): i5-4300M (HD4600), 8 GB RAM, 500 GB HDD, 1600x900px I'm not interested in the best graphics What is it? Zen is the current working name for AMD’s upcoming x86 microprocessor architecture. Zen is to replace the ‘Excavator’ microarchitecture which is the fourth and final revision to the ‘Bulldozer’ lineage of microprocessor architectures first released in October 2011. The Zen architecture began production in the 2012 timeframe, shortly after Bulldozer's release.
