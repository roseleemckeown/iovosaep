Teaser for Peter Greenaway's art-house masterpiece A ZED & TWO NOUGHTS Filmtrack: Soundtrack: Michael Nyman После просмотра «За садовой оградой» меня долго не покидало чувство, что я прикоснулся к чему то волшебному, более того я был частью этого волшебства. A Zed & Two Noughts is a 1985 film written and directed by Peter Greenaway. This film was Greenaway's first collaboration with cinematographer Sacha Vierny, who went on to shoot virtually all of Greenaway's work in the 1980s and 1990s, until Vierny's death.

A Zed & Two Noughts (1985) on IMDb: Movies, TV, Celebs This twisted black comedy is obsessed in turn with swans, twins, and decay. Alba Bewick (Andréa Ferréol) is involved in a swan-related car accident near the zoo. The accident kills two other women, the wives of two twin zoologists, Oliver and Oswald Deuce (Brian and Eric Deacon). Alba is lucky.  It was said that the swan seduced Leda. Perhaps it was in pursuit when it crashed through Alba's window, leaving her an amputee and two twins widowers whose obsession will lead to a tripedal love affair with sex, death, and decomposition. As the David Attenborough narration tells us, it takes. I also like Holy Motors, Hausu,Sexy Beast, and Synecdoche, New York. Basically anything decadent, surreal, bizarre, probably foreign and especially obscure. I'm planning to track down some more Greenaway films next, though I'm not sure which ones besides The Falls Oliver Deuce, a successful doctor, is shattered when his wife is killed in a freak car accident involving a car being driven by Alba Bewick colliding with a very large Product Description "Two legs look so good together, don't you think?" A masterpiece of modern cinema, A Zed and Two Noughts is Peter Greenaway's beautifully disturbing and darkly humorous take on erotic obsession and death. 
Over the last few weeks I have viewed four of his films: - The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover (1989) - 8/10 - Drowning by Numbers (1988) - 7/10 - The Belly of an Architect (1987) 7/10 - A Zed and Two Noughts (1985) - 7/10 I like what I have seen so far. I'm not entirely sure what some of his films are about per se, but they're quite the experience. I love the odd and sometimes vile scene decoration, unusual atmosphere and shot composition. The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. A Zed and Two Noughts is a 1985 film about twin zoologists who lose their wives in a car accident and become obsessed with decomposing animals. Written and directed by Peter Greenaway. What great - but obscure - film that you wish more people have seen? I loved a Zed and Two Noughts but I've never met anyone else who has seen it. It's Peter Greenaway and has an off putting subject matter, death and dismemberment and obsession, but I was deeply affected by it.

That’s what was rolling around in Zeds head as he made his way to the last drop off. He was pretty sure it was his last ever drop off as he was nearly certain his ass was about to get fired. Taking his time, cruising to his destination, Zed had time to reflect on the last 24 hours, what it meant for his future and how he felt about it all. Of course, getting fired by the guild wasnt as simple as getting fired from some dead beat job. No being a Courier was a big thing.

I don't know if it was the fact that it's hard to follow, the fact that it boasts Drama, black comedy, art film or body horror? Or a bit of each? Greenaway's second major film A Zed & Two Noughts is possibly the most abstract of the bunch from this period and not without a lot of lush visual detail.
